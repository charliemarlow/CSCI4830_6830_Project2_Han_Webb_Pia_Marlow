- to make it truly dark we'll need to mess with global illumination 
settings

- each level it could get progressively darker

- or at a certain level of lighting we can change it

- changing RenderSettings.reflectionIntensity = 0
- and RenderSettings.ambientIntensity = 0 
- should allow "true" darkness
