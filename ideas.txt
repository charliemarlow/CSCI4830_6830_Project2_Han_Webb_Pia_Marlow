General Ideas:
  Afternoon sun, Get to circuit breaker/basement as quick as possible before sun sets
  Each level is a separate scene
  goes down a building with increasingly less lighting from outside
  Can use flashlight, gets feedback on how much the flashlight is used
  Therapist can dim the rooms with the sun a bit more

Tasks for the patient:
  Picking up tools, keys, or batteries
  Fixing jammed doors
  Get to the next level 

Level 2: 
  More batteries from therapist
  Better lighting from the sun
  Controlled by therapist
  Brightness /focus of the flashlight
  Position of the sun/passage of time
  Possible door jam towards the bottom of the building, has to be fixed while it gets dark

Level 3
  Keep track of how long it takes them to get through level
  Track flashlight usage
  Track how often they check the watch
  Do surveys between each level

Tasks to complete:
- Create a working flashlight object with programmable width
- Create a working “sunset”
- Create clocks that are connected to the current sunlight
- Modeling the watch with info
  The ability to teleport around the room
  The ability to pickup/handle objects in the environment
  Opening and closing doors
  The ability to “fix” jammed doors
  Missing screws, or slightly unscrewed ones
  Creating models of each level, including doors, placing objects (tools, batteries, keys)
  Creating in game survey between each levels (in the stairway?)
  Giving therapist controls
  Tracking what the user is doing
